# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in contributing to this project! This repository exists to help developers learn to read code effectively, and your contributions can help make that learning easier for others.

---

## What We're Looking For

### Great Contributions

- **Clarity improvements:** Simpler explanations, better examples
- **Real-world additions:** Walkthroughs of actual repositories
- **New patterns:** Common structures not currently covered
- **Exercises:** Practice opportunities for readers
- **Typo fixes:** Always welcome

### What We Avoid

- **Abstraction for abstraction's sake:** Keep it practical
- **Framework-specific deep dives:** This is about reading code, not teaching frameworks
- **Over-complication:** If it needs extensive explanation, simplify it
- **Tools and plugins:** This repo is about thinking, not tooling

---

## Before Contributing

1. **Read the existing content** — Make sure your contribution fits the style and goals
2. **Check existing issues** — Someone may already be working on it
3. **Open an issue first** (for significant changes) — Let's discuss before you invest time

---

## Contribution Guidelines

### Style

- **Be concise.** Respect readers' time.
- **Use examples.** Show, don't just tell.
- **Be practical.** Every section should help someone read code.
- **Avoid jargon.** Explain terms or link to explanations.

### Format

- Use Markdown
- Keep lines reasonable (no strict limit, but readable)
- Use code blocks with language hints (```javascript)
- Use headers sparingly — content over structure

### File Organization

1. Fork the repository
2. Make your changes
3. Submit a pull request with a clear description

### For Larger Changes (new sections, patterns)

1. Open an issue describing what you want to add
2. Wait for feedback/approval
3. Fork the repository
4. Make your changes
5. Submit a pull request referencing the issue

## Adding a New Pattern

If you want to add a pattern for a project type not covered:

1. Follow the structure in existing pattern files
2. Include:
   - Common folder structure
   - Key files and their purposes
   - Framework-specific variations (if applicable)
   - What to ignore
   - Quick reference table
3. Link it from the main README

---

## Adding a New Walkthrough

If you want to add a real-world walkthrough:

1. Choose a public repository that:
   - Is reasonably stable (won't change structure tomorrow)
   - Represents a common pattern
   - Has educational value

2. Include:
   - Clear purpose statement
   - Step-by-step exploration with timestamps
   - What you ignored and why
   - What remained unclear
   - Time spent

3. Focus on the PROCESS, not just the result

---

## Adding Exercises

Good exercises:

- Use real, public repositories
- Have clear goals
- Can be completed in 30-45 minutes
- Build confidence, not exhaustion
- Include hints (in `<details>` tags)
- Have approximate "answers" for self-check

---

## Code of Conduct

Be kind. Be helpful. Remember that many readers are beginners who feel intimidated by code. Our goal is to reduce that intimidation, not add to it.
