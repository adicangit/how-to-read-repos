# 📘 How to Read GitHub Repositories (Without Getting Lost)

> Most developers are taught how to **write** code.  
> Very few are taught how to **read** other people’s code — which is 70% of real-world development.

This repository teaches a **practical, repeatable system** for understanding unfamiliar GitHub repositories **without panic, overwhelm, or reading every file**.

If you’ve ever opened a repo and thought *“where do I even start?”* — this is for you.

---

## 🎯 Who this is for

- Beginners who feel lost opening real-world repositories  
- Junior developers starting their first job  
- Self-taught developers transitioning to production code  
- Anyone who wants to **think like a senior engineer**

You do **not** need to be an expert to use this repo.

---

## 🧠 What this repo teaches (and what it doesn’t)

### ✅ What you’ll learn
- How to **approach** an unfamiliar codebase
- How to identify the **entry point**
- How to trace **one real feature end-to-end**
- What files and folders you can **safely ignore**
- How experienced developers explore repos quickly

### ❌ What this repo does NOT do
- Teach syntax of any language
- Explain frameworks in depth
- Turn you into a “10x developer” overnight

This is about **thinking**, not tools.

---

## 🧭 The Core Mental Model

Instead of reading files randomly, you will learn to ask questions **in the right order**:

Purpose → Project Type → Entry Point → One Feature Flow → Expand Only If Needed

Understanding **20% of the codebase deeply** is more valuable than skimming 100%.

## 📘 Section Overview

### 🧠 `mindset.md`
- Why confusion is normal
- Why you are NOT supposed to understand everything
- How senior engineers think when reading code
- How to avoid imposter syndrome while navigating repos

---

### 🧭 `navigation.md`
A step-by-step process for exploring **any** repository:
- Finding the entry point
- Recognizing architectural intent
- Following one meaningful flow
- Knowing when to stop

This is the **core algorithm** of the repo.

---

### 🧩 `patterns/`
Learn to recognize common structures instantly:
- Backend APIs
- Frontend apps
- Libraries vs applications
- Monorepos

Pattern recognition = speed.

---

### 🧪 `exercises/`
Hands-on practice:
- Open a real repo
- Answer a small set of questions
- Stop after 30–45 minutes
- Build confidence, not exhaustion

---

### 🔍 `real-world-walkthroughs/`
Annotated walkthroughs of:
- A clean repo
- An average repo
- A messy production repo

Including:
- What was ignored
- What mattered
- What remained unclear (on purpose)

---

## 🧑‍💼 Why this skill matters in real jobs

In real companies:
- You rarely write code from scratch
- You inherit large, messy codebases
- Your value is how fast you can **understand and contribute safely**

This repo trains that exact skill.

---

## 🚀 How to use this repo

1. Read `mindset.md` first  
2. Learn the process in `navigation.md`  
3. Pick ONE pattern that matches your stack  
4. Do ONE exercise  
5. Stop  

Repeat later.

**Do not binge-read.**

---

## 🤝 Contributions

Contributions are welcome if they:
- Improve clarity
- Add real-world examples
- Reduce confusion (not add abstraction)

Open an issue or PR.

---

## 📌 Final Note

Reading code is a skill.  
Feeling lost is part of the process.  
This repo exists to make that feeling **temporary instead of permanent**.
